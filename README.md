# React Drum Machine
<hr>
This project is something I built as part of freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries course. I learned about using React components and hooks, CSS grid styling and layout, and got the chance to practice JavaScript fundamentals such as map(), arrays, and objects. The tricky part with this project was getting the audio to play, and handling keyboard input.
